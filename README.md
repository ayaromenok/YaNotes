# YaTetra
Yet Another myTETRA - information manager and storage system

## Motivation
MyTetra[https://github.com/xintrea/mytetra_dev] is a great tool for store and manage information. Also it have some issues, like a large amount of legacy code, mixed language comments and no mobile client (well, you can build MyTetra for Andoid, but it will be unusable due to UI issues and sync via git will not work on non-rooted devices).

So, goals:
	- usage of C++11/Qt 5.9 as a basis;
	- English only doc\comments in code;
	- QtQuick\QML UI for mobile devices additionally to QtWidget for desktops;
	- sync on mobile devices;
	- simplified UI;
	
additional goals:
	- database in MD format - to use directly from GitHub/GitLab;
	- tablet\phone UI;
	- android separate screen support;
